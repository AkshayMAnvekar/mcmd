! This is an example of separation of water and octane via CUDA GPU MD
! You have to compile the code with cuda enabled
! e.g. bash compile.sh gpu
! Even with CUDA this system is quite large, and especially
! expensive because we are including k-space Ewald forces
! We recommend trying the _SMALL example first.
