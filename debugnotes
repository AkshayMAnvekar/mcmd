debug notes

polar explosion. ONLY polar. only high pressure (discovered @ 30atm in MOF5) -- seems new
co2 phast / phast*
h2 bssp
    -> user inputs
Trying with sorbate in input (not user)
    -> mpmc = mcmd initial energies ljespolar 
    if it explodes, check that state and mpmc energy compare
    it exploded (linux/mac and h2*/co2*).
    energies are equal mcmd/mpmc.
    it must be in acceptance condition or polarization energy calc after initial
    at 30atm
        -> testing 0-1atm 77k h2bssp user-input fugacity.
            ->it's working with no explosions..
        -> an old commit exploded at 30atm. I probably had this problem from the start.
        -> current version exlplodes at 0.5 - 1.0atm after ~8hrs. It's unrelated to pressure. 
    -> problem occurs independent of palmo on/off
        -> but explosion is exaggerated when palmo on
    -> I checked all functions vs mpmc; no apparent difference.
    -> Explodes whether manual sorbate is supplied or not.
-> THE FIRST POLARIZATION CALC IS CORRECT BUT THE NEXT ONES ARE NOT..
-> num_iterations is the same for both (4) every step
-> It must be either dipole or efield value because it's independent of palmo.
    -> checking if its efield by setting dipoles to 1 every time
        -> slowly beginning to explode @ spte 3075... Polar=-1830; ES=-1820, RD=-32100
        -> still under control @ 5150... POL=-3800, ES=-2580; RD=-36000
        -> still tame at 5575. stopping.

-> maybe test if its gauss-seidel ranking function?(turn off and compare to mpmc)

-> no frozens test: 77k 30atm h2bssp (with dip=1 force) EXPLODED by step 5725
    -> with palmo off: still tame @ 7750
    -> without dipole=1 force (normal calc): going well @ 9300. exploded by 661000

-> test AtomMap FOUND A BUG. wasn't clearing the atommap vector. probably fixed!!
