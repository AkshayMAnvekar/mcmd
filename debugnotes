debug notes

polar explosion. ONLY polar. only high pressure (discovered @ 30atm in MOF5) -- seems new
co2 phast / phast*
h2 bssp
    -> user inputs
Trying with sorbate in input (not user)
    -> mpmc = mcmd initial energies ljespolar 
    if it explodes, check that state and mpmc energy compare
    it exploded (linux/mac and h2*/co2*).
    energies are equal mcmd/mpmc.
    it must be in acceptance condition or polarization energy calc after initial
    at 30atm
        -> testing 1atm 77k h2bssp user-input fugacity.
